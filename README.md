Analysis of flights

This repository includes the analysis of a personal data set of all flights in the period of 2010-2020. 
In the first version (1.1) of the file I create tables and visualize data to find out answers to questions such as the cheapest day/month/year to fly in my data set, the most popular airline, the number of flights taken on a certain day of the week, etc.
